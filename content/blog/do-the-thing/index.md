## First up - before we really get into this
Thanks and credit where it's due [roberttables](https://twitter.com/drpoindexter) and particularly his [stream](https://twitch.tv/roberttables) was a big big big influence in getting this going.

## Why Now?
I wanted to do this for a while, but everything I tried - ended up being a chore - do this, do that, write the content, make sure I'm happy locally, then when happy "publish" it, edit it in the editor of the blog thingy to look how I wanted it.

In short...

With this setup ([gatsbyjs](https://gatsbyjs.org) starter and AWS amplify and some route53) means now I just create a markdown doc, git commit, git push, and it's out the door.

I even have a staging environment available [here](https://beta.leewilliams.dev) this is driven by a different branch but the process is the same behind the scenes apart from that, obviously the process then is repeatable and verifiable - we can move to "production" with a high confidence level.
